CloudHelp
=====
Welcome to CloudHelp. A fun way to offer help. A better and faster way to get help.

Many schools offer "CS Helpdesks" but they're constrained to a specific time of the day. The quality of such programs also depends on the knowledge of teh volunteers.
What if we could incentivize students who have already take these courses to help younger students in a fun way?

Using webcam chat, live editing and afun point based system, we have a set up where you don't need to wait to get help with a CS problem and you can earn cred among your school's cs community. 


How does it work?
------

1. Sign in with a @mail.mcgill.ca
3. Earn 5 points for current courses and 10 for past courses
4. Use your points to ask questions and get help (you offer a reward to incentivize people to answer your question)
5. Use your points to incentivize people to hop on a live chat with you to help you through a problem
5. Each question can have a maxium reward of 10 points
6. Earn points for hopping on a live chat with someone with help and leading them to a solution to their question
7. Earn points through the rewards offered by people with questions on their discussion board questions
 

Compete with friends to have the highest CloudHelp scores and make sure your homies in lower years enjoy their courses the way you did.
